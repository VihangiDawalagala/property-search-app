# HomeFind – Property Search SPA

A client-side single-page web application built using React and Vite, inspired by Rightmove.

## Note
This project is implemented as a fully client-side React SPA (Vite).
An initial Next.js setup was refactored to a pure client-side React SPA to comply with
the coursework requirement that **no server-side solution** may be used.  
All application logic runs entirely in the browser, with data loaded from local JSON files.


## Features
- Search properties by type, price, bedrooms, date added, and postcode
- View property details with image gallery and tabs
- Add and remove favourites (button + drag and drop)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Client-side security using CSP
- Unit testing with Jest

## Technologies Used
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI
- Jest & Testing Library
